# Overview
Magnetic stirring is a commonly used method for mixing reagents in chemistry experiments. Through a magnetic field in the stirrer, a stir bar spins quickly to mix components in a flask/vial, creating a uniform mixture and increasing the rate of reactions. This repository contains instructions / materials / code for creating a low-cost stirring module which is programmable and compatible with the Opentrons liquid handler deck slots, so it can be incorporated into automated workflows in self-driving labs (SDLs).

_(an image of the soldered PCB is attached below)_

### Soldering Steps
The following instructions will give a written description of the circuit diagram. If you are familiar with electronics, feel free to just solder the circuit diagram. 

1. Mount the barrel connector in the top left corner of the PCB. This creates a power port, where the pin at the back of the barrel connector is your +5V pin, and the pin closer to the opening is the ground (see below).
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/54123e2e-5e5e-465c-873b-4c60afbe5cbc" width = "250" height = "200">
   
2. The RPi ground pin wire can be a bare wire or a wire with an open pin. Solder in one end of the wire in series between the ground of the barrel connector and the rest of the circuit. The other end of the wire will be connected to the RPi Grove Shield in a later step.

3. For the MOSFET transistor, the drawing below shows the schematic of the transistor and identifies the pins. Pin 1 (gate) goes to the 390 Ohm resistor and RPi GPIO pin 0. Pin 2 (drain) goes to the ground terminal of the fans and Pin 3 (source) goes to the ground of the power supply.\

4. At pin 1, solder a 390 Ohm resistor and one end of the GPIO pin wire (bare or with open pin), like the ground pin wire.
   
5. At pin 2, solder in one end of a black wire. This will be connected to the ground wires of the fan. Repeat the same for a red wire for the +5V to the fans (see diagram).
   
6. Both the fan wires will be connected to a diode. Orient the diode so the silver bar (which indiciates the cathode) points towards the +5V terminal of the fan (the red wire). The diode is used to protect the circuit from the reverse flow of voltage after the fan is turned off, as rotational motors create a magnetic and energetic field which can flow in the opposite direction of the current, damaging the circuit. This way, it will flow back into the fan, using up the energy.

7. Wire a 10K Ohm resistor parallel to the ground side of the of the power supply and the 390 Ohm resistor at the transistor pin 1 (see diagram).

## 3b: Connecting PCB to Fans
1. Place the fans into the square slots in the base piece of the casing. Thread the wires through the hole at the bottom of each slot and collect the wires of the fans in the row at one end of the case.
2. Combine all the black wires (ground) together by twisting the exposed wires together securely. You should have the same number of black wires combined as the number of fans used. Repeat this step for the red wires.
3. Use a heat shrink connector to solder together the combined black wires with the "Fans (Black)(-)" wire from the PCB. Repeat for the red wire and the "Fans (Red)(+)" wire.

## 3c: Assemble PCB & Raspberry Pi
The last step to setting up is connecting the GPIO wires to the Raspberry Pi. The electronic casing (optional) can be printed and used to organize the wires in the project. Slide the side module in with the central square unit.
1. Attach the Raspberry Pi to the Grove Shield. Optionally, place the grove shield and PCB into the square unit and slide on the side unit of the electronic casing.
2. Connect the RPi GPIO Pin 0 wire to the "GP0" slot on the RPi Grove shield. If using the electronic casing, thread the wire through one of the honeycombs in the side panel.
3. Connect the RPi Ground Pin wire to any slot that says "GND" on the RPi Grove shield.

## 3d: Assemble Electronics Casing (Optional)
Finally, insert the side panels into the side module and put on the lids to complete the assembly of the electronics.

# Step 4:  Operating the Stirring Module
1. Download Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and Python.
2. Download the MicroPico Extension in VS Code, which will be used to communicate with the RPi.
3. Plug in the micro USB-B end of the cable into the RPi and the USB-A end into your computer, while pressing the BOOTSEL button on the RPi. This should open a file directory for the RPi on your computer.
4. **Flash the RPi** by downloading the [UF2 file for the RPi Pico W](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/micropython.html) and transferring the file into the RPi's directory. The file directory should disappear from your files explorer. Unplug and replug the RPi to your computer.
5. Download `stirring_module.py` and open it in VS Code. Feel free to edit this script to accomodate for different uses, for example for changing the stir speed and duration. 

This program contains methods for operating the fan, which are described below and also documented in comments within the script. These methods are called in a try-escape block (to be uncommented out in the code) where the program can be stopped by pressing `ctrl+c` on the keyboard. 
- `initialize_fans()`: This function initializes fans in preparation for stirring.
- `stir_for_duration(power, duration)`: commands the fans to stir at a given power (1-100) which is controlled through pwm signals, for a designated amount of time in _minutes_.
- `stir(power)`: commands the fans to stir at the given power until the stop() command is run
- `stop()`: stops and deinitializes the fans
- `initialize_and_stir(power, duration)`: initializes and stirs for the specified duration of time
- `controller_stir(power)`: to be used in a controller class to command the fans to stir at a certain power
- `controller_stop()`: to be used in a controller class to stop stirring

- The on-board LED is also turned on while stirring is on, and turned off when stirring is stopped.

6. To run the file, right click in the editor and select **"Upload file to Pico"** and **"Run File on Pico"** afterwards. Be sure to **uncomment** the try-escape block to run the methods described.

7. Optionally, the module can be run without using the MicroPico REPL terminal, using the Python subpackage module. Download and run `stirring_module_controller.py`, where the fans can be commanded to start stirring (`start_stirring(power)`), stop stirring (`stop_stirring()`) and stir for a specified duration (`stir_for_duration(power,duration)`).
      -  Note that `stirring_module.py` needs to be uploaded to the RPi and the Pico needs to be disconnected in the MicroPico terminal. As well, the **COM number** (in line 15 of stirring_module_controller.py) needs to be changed to the COM number your module is connected to. You can check this through Windows > Device manager > Ports.

*🎉🎉Congratulations you are all set for using the stirring module!*

## Tested Power Values for Solutions of Various Viscosities
- Minimum power: **45** for all fans to turn on. Lower than this, only some fans will operate.
- Maximum power: **92**. Higher than this, the fans turn too quickly and the whole module starts to shake.

| Solution (listed in increasing viscosity) | Micro Stir Bar | Larger Stir Bar (514) |
| ---- | ----| ----|
| Acetone | 45-75 | 60-75 (80 starts to bounce) |
| Water  | 45-70 | 60-90 |
| 0.1% PEG in water  | 45-80 | 50-80 |
| 10% PEG in water  | 45-85 | 60-85 |
| 25% PEG in water  | 70-92 (for all speeds - mainly vibrates and doesn't stir well) | 70-80 |
| 50% PEG in water | Not possible | Not possible (70 moves very slowly, still only vibrating at 92) |

## Trouble Shooting Common Errors
**Error 1**: Trouble Connecting to RPi (when using the MicroPico Extension in VSCode)
![Screenshot of Micropico Connection Error](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/304d4ee8-6075-4c89-b44c-f000ccae95ec)
or a `error running on raw repl` \
=> Restart VSCode. If this does not help, restart your computer.\
Other potential solutions: uninstall / reinstall MicroPico extension & check if the RPi is connected (Windows > Device Manager > Ports, To see if RPi is connected via USB) 

**Error 2**: COM in use (when using subprocess to operate RPi) \
Ensure the RPi is disconnected in the MicroPico REPL terminal, as both can not be connected at the same time.

**Error 3**: mpremote module not found \
Try installing and reinstalling the mpremote package using pip install.

**Error 4**: on-board LED not turning on \
Back up all files on the RPi and disconnect from your computer. NOTE: Bootsel mode will remove all files on the microcontroller. Put the RPi in bootsel mode (by pressing the bootsel button) and reconnect it to your computer while the button is pressed. Reinstall the RPi [firmware](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/micropython.html).

## Current Limitations & Future Work
- Currently, the individual fans are spinning at slightly different speeds which is important to note for lower stir speeds as some fans may stop stirring as it does not have enough power. Future prototypes should work on improving electrical connections to the fans, as this is the suspected reason for this issue.
- Orchestration with the Opentrons / other liquid dispensers
